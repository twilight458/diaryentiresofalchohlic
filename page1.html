    <p>05:52 I wake with a headache and a dry mouth. I need a drink. There is a half bottle of cider by my chair
        and two cans in the fridge. The off licence opens at 8am. I need to find some money.
        <p>

        07:00 It will take 40 minutes to walk to the off licence. I search in all of the pockets of my trousers and
        coats, look in drawers and anywhere else there might be some money. I find a fiver and some change, it's
        not enough for a a bottle of cider and some cans but I will work something out.
        <p>
        07:48 At the shopping centre, just as I am going in I see a man I knew from school, who I haven't seen in
        years. He says hello. I ask him if he can loan me a fiver. He looks at me with a mixture of confusion and
        pity and gives me a tenner. I thank him so much that I think I might start crying.
        <p/>
        08:15 On the way home I stop by the lake. We used to drink here when we were teenagers that was 30
        years ago and I still come here to get drunk and reminisce. Everything has changed except me.
        10:03 I wake up sitting by the lake. When I started to get a bit drunk I must have fallen asleep. I open a
        can to drink as I continue walking home.
        <p>
        10:51 Not far from home passing the pub I see an old friend he asks how I am and invites me for a pint.
        He feels sorry for me. He keeps saying that he's always liked me and that we would hate to see any harm
        come to me. His Dad was an alcoholic who died some years ago. I think I remind him of his Dad.
        <p/>
        12:17 After a few pints my mate goes home and another lad who I know buys me a pint, then the bar man
        buys me one. I have known these people all my life. They've always been good to me.
        <p>
        14:04 I have had a lot to drink and fallen asleep in the corner of the bar. The barman asks if I am OK. He
        orders me a taxi to get me home.
        <p/>
        14:27 I get home I have a big bottle of strong cider, a bottle of cheap wine and 3 or 4 cans. I sit down and
        put some music on and start drinking.
        <p>
        14:30 I know I am an alcoholic and I have tried to stop drinking several times but wasn't able to get more
        than a few hours. I accept the way that I am and although it makes me sad and part of me would like to
        stop, I can't.
        <p/>
        15:42 I am mixing cider and wine.. There arte no apples in this cider, it's strongg. I gett flashess in mu
        head form it. Electric shockis. Like a monchrome kelidescope is attach to my eyes.
        <p>
        19:06 I must have fallen asleep. I wake with a headache and a dry mouth. I need a drink. There is a half
        bottle of cider by my chair and two cans in the fridge. The off licence opens at 8am. I need to find some
        money.</p>
