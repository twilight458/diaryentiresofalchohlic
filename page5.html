    <h1>Diary of an Alcoholic written by Seamus Fox</h1>
    
    <p><strong>07:13</strong> I wake hungover. I need a drink but I would like to stop. There is wine in the kitchen but maybe I will try to stop again.</p>
    
    <p><strong>07:50</strong> I am pacing the room. Having a conversation with myself in the mirror in the living room. I am asking myself not to drink and telling myself that I need a drink. It's like I am two people. One who needs to stop and the other who needs a drink.</p>
    
    <p><strong>08:13</strong> I wish I could stop drinking. I have been trying but I can't. I shouldn't try to stop now because I might have a seizure.</p>
    
    <p><strong>08:47</strong> I am beginning to shake, it's withdrawal. I should go to the doctor in the next few days and ask if I can medically detox. I think I need to go to rehab but I can't stop now or I'll have a seizure.</p>
    
    <p><strong>08:55</strong> I pour myself a big glass of wine. I am warm and fuzzy as the first big gulp enters my body followed by big sigh and a feeling of relief. I love this feeling but I hate that it doesn't stay like this. It changes as I drink more and turns into hatred when it wears off. It only takes about 10 seconds for the shaking to stop.</p>
    
    <p><strong>09:35</strong> Why do I have to drink? I wish I didn't have to. I miss my Mum. She died seven years ago and every time I drink I miss her. I start crying. I need to go see my Mum.</p>
    
    <p><strong>10:01</strong> I call my sister who drives over to collect me. She's taking me to see my Mum. She says she's worried about me. She says I am killing myself. She says this can't go on. She asks me why she bothers. She's crying.</p>
    
    <p><strong>10:10</strong> I get out of the car after the short drive to the graveyard. I have nearly two full bottles of wine with me. My sister drives away and says she'll be back for me later.</p>
    
    <p><strong>10:15</strong> I fall on the way down the graveyard. A stranger helps me up and asks if I am OK. Of course I am fucking OK I tell them. It's because my mothers dead.</p>
    
    <p><strong>10:20</strong> I drink my wine and cry at my mothers grave.</p>
    
    <p><strong>13:01</strong> I must have fallen asleep. I wake up and there's still a full bottle of wine. Result. I start drinking that.</p>
    
    <p><strong>13:40</strong> I am nearly finished my wine and I start walking back towards home. I can buy more wine on the way back.</p>
    
    <p><strong>15:45</strong> I wake up in hospital. They tell me that I was found at the side of the road. The doctor looks like she's really worried about me. She is asking me all sorts of questions. I ask her if she has any wine. If I don't get wine I will have seizures, I tell her. What if I could get you into rehab she asks me? I would love to go to rehab I tell her but can I have some wine first?</p>
